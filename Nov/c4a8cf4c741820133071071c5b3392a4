A British surfer has broken his back after falling off his board while riding a huge wave. Andrew Cotton, from Braunton, Devon, was in Nazaré, Portugal, when he came off his board. The 36-year-old was rescued from the water and placed on a spinal board before being taken to hospital. Cotton told reporters: “What can I say? I got a little excited this morning and ending up having possibly the worst wipeout impact-wise of my life. Thank you to all the lifeguards and crew on the beach who helped stabilise me and do a great spinal recovery. I can’t name everyone but you all did your bit to get me safely to the hospital. “I have broken my back but I’ve been really lucky. I’m already looking forward and focusing my energy to get fit and back out there on some more big rollers.” Cotton, a world record-holder, is credited with having surfed the world’s biggest wave at Praia do Norte, in Portugal.
