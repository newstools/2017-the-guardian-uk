I need only remember my graduation ball to know that a man in a well-cut suit is an all too rare thing. But there are people who wear suits as if they’re doing the garment a favour, and we should applaud them when we see them. So put your hands together for Irish-American actor Pierce Brosnan. Have better shoulders-in-a-suit ever existed? I think not. I first saw Brosnan, who turns 64 next week, in Mrs Doubtfire, playing the new hunk in Sally Field’s life. He left no real impression – the film belonged to Robin Williams, after all. But then came James Bond. I was 13 when GoldenEye was released, and I fell instantly in love. (Disclaimer: my favourite Bond is Timothy Dalton, but Brosnan is a close second.) Brosnan felt like Bond to me. There’s the face, which in 1995 was smoothly handsome: dark hair and eyes that bored into you, convincing villains to confess their complex world domination plans. Then there was his aura: Brosnan always looked as if he was having fun, delivering bad puns with ease; winking without actually winking. His defining trait is persuasive suaveness. I was genuinely sad when his tenure ended, but he’s so much more than Bond. He’s in some of my favourite films: the wonderful Thomas Crown Affair remake was built around those shoulders; his funny, weirdly touching performance in The Matador (playing an emotionally needy assassin) might be the one I like the best. Now older and more grizzled, he’s starring as Texas oil baron Eli McCullough in The Son. I’m not sure it’s a great show, but Brosnan remains eminently watchable, even with his wandering accent. And, yes, even without a tux.
