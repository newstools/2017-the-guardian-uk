What were you hoping for?A fun evening with interesting company. First impressions?Tall, great bone structure, warm smile. What did you talk about?Family, films, books, careers. Any awkward moments?It was really hot in the restaurant, so I kept fanning myself like a delicate Dickensian woman. Good table manners?There was no shovelling, which is always a positive. Best thing about Tomas?He was considerate, and I liked his sense of humour. Would you introduce him to your friends? Yes, I think they’d like him. Describe him in three wordsIntelligent, kind, funny. What do you think he made of you?I think he thought I was a bit of all right. Did you go on somewhere?Yes. And... did you kiss?Yes, briefly. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?I had a lovely evening with a special person. I wouldn’t change a thing. Marks out of 10?10. Would you meet again?We swapped numbers, so, yes, I think we will. What were you hoping for?Someone to impress with my Star Trek knowledge. First impressions?“She looks extremely cool.” What did you talk about?Vomit, urinal etiquette, nude cycling. Any awkward moments?Absolutely not. Good table manners?I kept a keen eye out for mistakes: none to report. Best thing about Lizzie?She made me laugh a lot. Would you introduce her to your friends? Yes, I would. Describe her in three wordsWarm, creative, interesting. What do you think she made of you?She must have thought I was a hunk. Guilty as charged. Did you go on somewhere?To a nearby pub. And... did you kiss?I’m delighted to announce that we did. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?Nothing. Marks out of 10?10, and a bonus point for her idiosyncratic taste in films. Would you meet again?Yes, she is great company. • Lizzie and Tomas ate at Galvin Bistrot de Luxe, London W1.
