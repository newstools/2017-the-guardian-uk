Today we are excited to announce the launch of our new and improved football notifications in our latest update to the Guardian app. Our Mobile Innovation Lab has been researching innovative ways of using push notifications to keep you updated on the go. We have taken the award-winning research and made a significant upgrade to our existing goal alerts feature. We know notifications can sometimes feel intrusive and that is why, with our new football notifications, we will send you only a single notification per match. We will update it throughout the game with the latest live news – keeping your lock screen nice and tidy. Updates will cover the kick-off, any goals and the result at half-time and full-time. You will also be able to click through to our unrivalled live blogs. We will be adding different types of updates and leagues to the service soon, such as red/yellow cards and substitutions. In order to get the new notifications you need to have the latest version of the Guardian app, which can be downloaded or updated here for iOS or Android. How do I get updates for my favourite team? It is very simple. Look for the “Don’t miss a goal” banner just below sport on your home screen or below news in the football section and tap on “pick your team” (it will not appear though, if you are already signed up to a team). Or go via the app settings: How do I get updates for an individual game? Again very simple. How do I switch off notifications that I no longer want? Our work on this feature is far from finished. We have plenty of ideas, but we value yours more. Please send us your ideas here.
